# This project is still a work in progress

This project was done as one of the requirements to earn my certification in Responsive Web Design from FreeCodeCamp. After submitting basic code written in a codepen.io environment to pass FCC tests and meet requirements, I did additional coding and design work in my local environment to showcase a complete project.
